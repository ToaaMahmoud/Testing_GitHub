## Framework and library

**Framework:** It is the one which you write your code in and includes a set of libraries and determines the structure of the code

**Library:** It is the one you include in your code and it includes a set of functions that are called to perform a spacific task

## Compiler and preprocessor

**Preprocessor:** program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input in another program.

Takes in code in language X - transforms it in some way - and outputs language X code.

For example useing "bug" preprocessor for html.

```html
  .parent hello world
```

```html
  <div class="parent">hello world</div>
```


**Compiler:** takes in code in language X - and output it in machine code (or possibly assembly language).

## Typescript and JavaScript

**Static Typing:**

* TypeScript is a statically-typed language, which means that you must declare the data types of variables.
* JavaScript, on the other hand, is dynamically typed, allowing variables to change types during runtime.

**Compilation:**

* TypeScript requires compilation before running in a browser, which can catch errors at compile time.
* JavaScript is interpreted and executed directly by the browser or a JavaScript engine.

**Community and Ecosystem:**

* JavaScript has a larger community and a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
* While TypeScript is growing in popularity, it's not as widely adopted.

**Type System:**

* TypeScript has a strong type system, which helps catch type-related errors during development.
* JavaScript has a weaker type system, which can lead to runtime errors.

**Use Cases:**

* TypeScript is often preferred for larger, complex projects where type safety and maintainability are critical.
* JavaScript is still widely used for web development and smaller scripts.

In summary, TypeScript is JavaScript with added static typing and development tooling,
which can lead to safer and more maintainable code, especially in larger projects. The choice between them depends on the specific needs and preferences of a project and its developers.
